# FoxDot Jam Sessions

Storage for coded music I've created using [supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) and [foxdot](https://foxdot.org/).

A lot of my files use samples and synths from a _top-secret_ branch: [killa_features](https://github.com/MrMebelMan/FoxDot/tree/killa_features)

:)
